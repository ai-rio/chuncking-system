- Simple unit tests
- Basic refactoring
- 2-4 hours of work

#### **3 Points - Moderate**
- Medium feature implementation
- Integration testing
- API endpoint creation
- 4-8 hours of work

#### **5 Points - Complex**
- Complex feature implementation
- Multiple component integration
- Performance optimization
- 1-2 days of work

#### **8 Points - Very Complex**
- Large feature implementation
- Architecture changes
- Complex integrations
- 2-3 days of work

#### **13 Points - Epic**
- Major feature implementation
- Multiple team coordination
- Significant architecture changes
- 3-5 days of work
- *Consider breaking down further*

#### **21 Points - Too Large**
- Should be broken down into smaller stories
- Requires epic-level planning
- Multiple sprint implementation

## Daily Standup Guidelines

### **Format (15 minutes max)**
Each team member answers:
1. **What did I complete yesterday?**
2. **What will I work on today?**
3. **What blockers or impediments do I have?**

### **Best Practices**
- Focus on work, not personal activities
- Mention specific story/task IDs
- Highlight blockers clearly
- Keep discussions brief - detail conversations after standup
- Update sprint board before standup

### **Scrum Master Focus Areas**
- Track progress toward sprint goal
- Identify and address blockers
- Facilitate team communication
- Update burndown charts
