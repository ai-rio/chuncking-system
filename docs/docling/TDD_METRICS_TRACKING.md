## Automated Metrics Collection

### **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

#### **Automated Test Coverage Reports**
```yaml
# Example Jenkins/GitHub Actions step
- name: Generate Coverage Report
  run: |
    pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=90
    coverage html
    
- name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```

#### **TDD Compliance Check**
```python
# Example script to check commit patterns
def check_tdd_compliance(commit_messages):
    red_commits = [msg for msg in commit_messages if msg.startswith("RED:")]
    green_commits = [msg for msg in commit_messages if msg.startswith("GREEN:")]
    refactor_commits = [msg for msg in commit_messages if msg.startswith("REFACTOR:")]
    
    compliance_ratio = len(red_commits + green_commits + refactor_commits) / len(commit_messages)
    return compliance_ratio > 0.9
```

#### **Quality Gate Configuration**
```yaml
# SonarQube quality gate example
