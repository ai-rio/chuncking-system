# TDD Daily Workflow Guide - Docling Integration

## Daily TDD Cycle for Development Teams

### **Morning Routine (15 minutes)**

#### **1. Review Yesterday's Work**
- [ ] Check which tests are currently failing
- [ ] Review commit history to ensure TDD cycle was followed
- [ ] Identify any incomplete Red-Green-Refactor cycles

#### **2. Plan Today's TDD Cycles**
- [ ] Select user story or task to work on
- [ ] Identify specific behavior to test first
- [ ] Set goal for number of TDD cycles (typically 3-4 per day)

#### **3. Environment Setup**
- [ ] Pull latest code and run full test suite
- [ ] Ensure test environment is clean
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are working

---

## TDD Cycle Implementation (Repeat 3-4 times daily)

### **Phase 1: RED (15-30 minutes)**
**Goal**: Write a failing test that defines desired behavior

#### **Steps**:
1. **Choose One Behavior**: Select a single, specific behavior to implement
2. **Write Failing Test**: Create test that describes expected behavior
3. **Verify Test Fails**: Run test to confirm it fails for the right reason
4. **Commit Test**: Commit failing test with descriptive message

#### **Example for DoclingProcessor**:
```python
# RED Phase - Write failing test
def test_process_pdf_returns_structured_content():
    """Test that PDF processing returns structured content with metadata."""
    processor = DoclingProcessor()
    pdf_path = Path("tests/fixtures/sample.pdf")
    
    result = processor.process_document(pdf_path)
    
    assert result["success"] is True
    assert "content" in result
    assert "metadata" in result
    assert result["format"] == "pdf"
    assert len(result["content"]) > 0
```

#### **Commit Message Template**:
```
RED: Add test for PDF processing functionality

- Test verifies DoclingProcessor can process PDF documents
- Expects structured output with content and metadata
- Part of DOC-003-TDD story implementation

[Failing test - implementation needed]
```

### **Phase 2: GREEN (30-60 minutes)**
**Goal**: Write minimal code to make the test pass

#### **Steps**:
1. **Minimal Implementation**: Write simplest code that makes test pass
2. **Run Test**: Verify test now passes
3. **Run All Tests**: Ensure no regressions
4. **Commit Implementation**: Commit working code

#### **Example Implementation**:
```python
# GREEN Phase - Minimal implementation
class DoclingProcessor:
    def process_document(self, file_path: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Minimal implementation to make test pass
        return {
            "success": True,
            "content": "Extracted text content",
            "metadata": {"format": "pdf"},
            "format": "pdf"
        }
```

#### **Commit Message Template**:
```
GREEN: Implement minimal PDF processing

- DoclingProcessor now passes basic PDF processing test
- Returns required structure with content and metadata
- Minimal implementation for DOC-003-TDD

[Test passing - ready for refactor]
```

### **Phase 3: REFACTOR (15-30 minutes)**
**Goal**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

#### **Steps**:
1. **Identify Improvements**: Look for code smells, duplication, clarity issues
2. **Refactor Incrementally**: Make small improvements one at a time
3. **Run Tests After Each Change**: Ensure tests stay green
4. **Commit Refactored Code**: Commit improved code

#### **Example Refactoring**:
```python
# REFACTOR Phase - Improve code quality
class DoclingProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.converter = DocumentConverter()
    
    def process_document(self, file_path: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        try:
            # Better error handling and real implementation
            conversion_result = self.converter.convert(str(file_path))
            return self._format_result(conversion_result, file_path)
        except Exception as e:
            return self._create_error_result(str(e))
    
    def _format_result(self, conversion_result, file_path: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "success": True,
            "content": conversion_result.document.export_to_markdown(),
            "metadata": {"format": "pdf", "source": str(file_path)},
            "format": "pdf"
        }
    
    def _create_error_result(self, error_message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": error_message,
            "content": "",
            "metadata": {},
            "format": "unknown"
        }
```

#### **Commit Message Template**:
```
REFACTOR: Improve DoclingProcessor implementation

- Extract helper methods for better code organization
- Add proper error handling with DocumentConverter
- Improve readability and maintainability
- All tests remain green

[Refactored - ready for next cycle]
```

## Daily Quality Checks

### **Mid-Day Check (12:00 PM)**
- [ ] Review test coverage - should be increasing
- [ ] Check that recent commits follow TDD pattern
- [ ] Verify no broken tests in main branch
- [ ] Quick code review of morning's TDD cycles

### **End-of-Day Review (5:00 PM)**
- [ ] Run full test suite locally
- [ ] Ensure all commits follow TDD pattern
- [ ] Push completed TDD cycles to remote branch
- [ ] Update task board with TDD progress
- [ ] Plan tomorrow's first TDD cycle

---

## TDD Metrics Tracking

### **Individual Developer Metrics** (Track daily)
- **TDD Cycles Completed**: Target 3-4 per day
- **Test Coverage Increase**: Track % increase daily
- **Commit Pattern Compliance**: % commits following Red-Green-Refactor
- **Cycle Time**: Average time per complete TDD cycle

### **Team Metrics** (Track weekly)
- **Overall Test Coverage**: Target >90%
- **Test-to-Code Ratio**: Lines of test code vs. implementation code
- **Defect Rate**: Bugs found in TDD-developed code
- **Refactoring Frequency**: % of cycles that include refactoring

---

## TDD Pair Programming Guidelines

### **When to Pair**
- Complex features requiring multiple TDD cycles
- New team members learning TDD
- Cross-team knowledge sharing
- Challenging technical problems

### **Pair Roles**
- **Driver**: Writes tests and code
- **Navigator**: Reviews tests, suggests improvements, ensures TDD compliance
- **Switch**: Every 25-30 minutes or after each complete cycle

### **Pair TDD Workflow**
1. **Discuss**: Navigator and driver discuss what to test next
2. **RED**: Driver writes failing test with navigator review
3. **GREEN**: Driver implements minimal code to pass
4. **REFACTOR**: Both discuss and implement improvements
5. **Switch**: Change roles for next cycle

## Common TDD Pitfalls and Solutions

### **Pitfall 1: Writing Too Much Code in GREEN Phase**
**Problem**: Implementing multiple features instead of minimal code
**Solution**: Force yourself to write absolute minimum to make test pass

### **Pitfall 2: Skipping REFACTOR Phase**
**Problem**: Accumulating technical debt
**Solution**: Always refactor, even if it's just improving variable names

### **Pitfall 3: Writing Tests After Implementation**
**Problem**: Tests that don't drive design
**Solution**: Strict code review process checking commit history

### **Pitfall 4: Testing Implementation Details**
**Problem**: Brittle tests that break with refactoring
**Solution**: Focus tests on behavior, not implementation

### **Pitfall 5: Large, Complicated Tests**
**Problem**: Hard to understand what's being tested
**Solution**: One behavior per test, clear test names

## TDD Code Review Checklist

### **For Review Authors**
- [ ] Every feature has corresponding tests written first
- [ ] Commit history shows Red-Green-Refactor pattern
- [ ] Tests focus on behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Code coverage increased appropriately
- [ ] Refactoring phase cleaned up any code smells

### **For Reviewers**
- [ ] Verify tests were written before implementation
- [ ] Check test quality and clarity
- [ ] Ensure tests actually test the intended behavior
- [ ] Validate that minimal implementation was used in GREEN
- [ ] Confirm refactoring improved code quality

### **Review Comments Templates**
```
✅ Good TDD: "Great test-first approach! The test clearly describes expected behavior."

❌ TDD Issue: "This looks like test-after development. Can you show the failing test commit?"

💡 TDD Suggestion: "Consider breaking this into smaller TDD cycles for better design."
```
