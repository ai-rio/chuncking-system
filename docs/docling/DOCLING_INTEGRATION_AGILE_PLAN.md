## Sprint Structure

### Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
### Team Velocity: Estimated 40-50 story points per sprint per team

## TDD Methodology Integration

### **TDD Principles**
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Every feature follows TDD cycle
- **Test-First Development**: Tests written before implementation code
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to make tests pass
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### **TDD Quality Gates**
- **Code Reviews**: Verify tests were written before implementation
- **Commit History**: Test commits must precede implementation commits
- **Test Coverage**: >90% test coverage required for all new code
- **TDD Metrics**: Track cycle time, test-to-code ratio, defect rates

### **TDD Team Practices**
- **Daily TDD Stand-ups**: Discuss failing tests and TDD progress
- **Pair Programming**: TDD pairs for complex features
- **Test Reviews**: Dedicated review of test quality and coverage
- **TDD Retrospectives**: Weekly TDD effectiveness discussions
