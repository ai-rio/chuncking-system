# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1**: The system shall process PDF documents using Docling while maintaining existing Markdown processing functionality without any changes to current API interfaces.

**FR2**: The system shall process DOCX (Word) documents through Docling integration, extracting text, structure, and formatting information for optimal chunking.

**FR3**: The system shall process PPTX (PowerPoint) documents via Docling, handling slides, text content, and embedded visual elements.

**FR4**: The system shall process HTML documents through Docling while preserving semantic structure and hierarchy information.

**FR5**: The system shall process image files (PNG, JPEG, TIFF) using Docling's vision capabilities to extract and describe visual content.

**FR6**: The FileHandler component shall automatically detect document formats and route to appropriate processors (existing Markdown or new Docling processor).

**FR7**: The system shall provide a DoclingProvider implementing the existing BaseLLMProvider interface for seamless integration with the current LLM factory pattern.

**FR8**: The HybridChunker shall integrate Docling's document understanding capabilities while preserving existing chunking strategies for Markdown files.

**FR9**: The quality evaluation system shall assess multi-format documents using enhanced metrics that account for visual content and document structure.

**FR10**: The system shall maintain existing command-line interface and Python API while adding optional Docling-specific configuration parameters.

## Non Functional

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 20% for Markdown processing.

**NFR2**: Multi-format document processing shall complete within 3x the time of equivalent Markdown processing (accounting for increased complexity).

**NFR3**: The system shall maintain 95%+ test coverage including comprehensive testing for all new Docling integration components.

**NFR4**: All existing monitoring, logging, and observability infrastructure shall continue to function with enhanced metrics for multi-format processing.

**NFR5**: The system shall handle Docling API failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms and appropriate error messaging.

**NFR6**: Configuration management shall support Docling API credentials and settings through existing Pydantic-based configuration system.

**NFR7**: Security validation shall extend to new file formats with appropriate file type, size, and content validation for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, and image files.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **Existing API Compatibility**: All current Python API methods, return types, and CLI arguments must remain unchanged and fully functional.

**CR2**: **Database Schema Compatibility**: Existing chunk metadata schema must be preserved with optional extensions for multi-format document properties.

**CR3**: **UI/UX Consistency**: Health endpoints, monitoring dashboards, and observability interfaces must maintain current functionality with enhanced multi-format metrics.

**CR4**: **Integration Compatibility**: Existing LLM provider integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Jina) must continue functioning without modification while supporting Docling provider addition.
