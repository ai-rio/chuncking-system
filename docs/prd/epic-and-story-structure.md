# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as a **single comprehensive epic** because:

1. **Architectural Cohesion**: All Docling integration components are tightly interconnected (DoclingProcessor, DoclingProvider, enhanced FileHandler, extended evaluators) and must work together as a unified system.

2. **Existing System Integration**: The enhancement leverages your proven pluggable architecture patterns, requiring coordinated changes across multiple existing modules that share dependencies.

3. **Quality Assurance**: Maintaining your 95% test coverage and enterprise monitoring requires integrated testing across all new components simultaneously.

4. **Risk Management**: A single epic allows for coordinated rollout with comprehensive integration verification, essential for preserving your production-ready system integrity.

5. **Team Coordination**: Your planned 3-parallel-team approach (Document Processing Core, LLM & Vision Integration, Quality & Observability) aligns with a single epic structure with coordinated stories.

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale: "Docling Multi-Format Integration represents a cohesive architectural enhancement that extends proven system patterns rather than adding separate unrelated features."
