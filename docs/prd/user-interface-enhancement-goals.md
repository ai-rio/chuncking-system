# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The Docling enhancement will integrate seamlessly with existing interface patterns:

**Command-Line Interface**: New Docling-specific options will follow existing argument patterns (`--docling-api-key`, `--enable-vision-processing`) while maintaining all current CLI functionality unchanged.

**Python API**: DoclingProvider will implement the established BaseLLMProvider interface, ensuring consistent programmatic access patterns. New multi-format capabilities will be accessible through existing methods with optional format-specific parameters.

**Health Endpoints**: Existing monitoring infrastructure (`/health`, `/metrics`, `/system/info`) will be enhanced with Docling-specific health checks and processing metrics while preserving current endpoint contracts.

**Configuration Interface**: Docling settings will integrate with existing Pydantic-based configuration system, following established patterns for API key management and provider configuration.

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced CLI Output**: Processing status will include document format detection and Docling processing stages while maintaining existing progress reporting structure.

**Extended Health Dashboard**: Monitoring interfaces will display multi-format processing metrics, Docling API status, and vision processing performance alongside existing system health indicators.

**Quality Reports**: Existing quality evaluation reports will be enhanced with multi-format document metrics while preserving current report structure and readability.

## UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Consistency**: All new interface elements must match existing console output formatting, error message patterns, and progress indicator styles.

**Interaction Consistency**: New CLI options and API parameters must follow established naming conventions and help documentation patterns.

**Error Handling Consistency**: Docling-related errors must integrate with existing exception hierarchy and error reporting mechanisms, maintaining consistent user experience.
