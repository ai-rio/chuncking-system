# Epic 5, Story 1: File Security Validation

## Story Overview

**Epic**: Security & Validation Framework  
**Story ID**: 5.1  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 5 Story Points  

## User Story

**As a** security administrator  
**I want** comprehensive file security validation  
**So that** malicious files cannot compromise the system  

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Path traversal attacks are detected and prevented
- [ ] File type validation prevents execution of malicious files
- [ ] File size limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- [ ] Content scanning detects potentially malicious content
- [ ] Security validation results are clearly reported

## TDD Requirements

- Write tests for attack detection before implementing security validation
- Test prevention mechanisms before creating security controls
- Verify security reporting before implementing reporting features

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All common attack vectors are detected and prevented
- [ ] Security validation is fast and doesn't impact performance
- [ ] Security reports are detailed and actionable
- [ ] False positive rates are minimized
- [ ] All tests pass in RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Cell executes without errors in clean environment
- [ ] Clear visual feedback provided to user
- [ ] Error handling for security violations implemented

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Security Components to Demonstrate
```python
# Core security modules
from src.security.security import SecurityConfig, PathSanitizer, FileValidator
from src.utils.monitoring import SystemMonitor
from src.utils.performance import PerformanceMonitor

# Security validation libraries
import os
import hashlib
import magic
from pathlib import Path
import re
```

### Security Validation Functions
```python
def validate_file_path(file_path):
    """Validate file path against traversal attacks"""
    pass

def validate_file_type(file_path):
    """Validate file type and extension"""
    pass

def validate_file_size(file_path, max_size_mb=100):
    """Validate file size limits"""
    pass

def scan_file_content(file_path):
    """Scan file content for malicious patterns"""
    pass

def generate_security_report(validation_results):
    """Generate comprehensive security validation report"""
    pass
```

### Attack Scenarios to Test
- Path traversal: `../../../etc/passwd`
- Executable files: `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh` files
- Oversized files: Files exceeding size limits
- Script injection: Files containing malicious scripts
- Binary exploits: Files with suspicious binary patterns

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Path Traversal Detection
```python
def test_path_traversal_detection():
    """Test detection of path traversal attacks"""
    # RED: Write failing test for traversal detection
    # GREEN: Implement traversal detection
    # REFACTOR: Optimize detection logic
    pass
```

### Test Case 2: File Type Validation
```python
def test_file_type_validation():
    """Test file type validation and blocking"""
    # RED: Write failing test for type validation
    # GREEN: Implement type validation
    # REFACTOR: Optimize validation performance
    pass
```

### Test Case 3: File Size Limits
```python
def test_file_size_limits():
    """Test file size limit enforcement"""
    # RED: Write failing test for size limits
    # GREEN: Implement size checking
    # REFACTOR: Optimize size validation
    pass
```

### Test Case 4: Content Scanning
```python
def test_content_scanning():
    """Test malicious content detection"""
    # RED: Write failing test for content scanning
    # GREEN: Implement content scanning
    # REFACTOR: Optimize scanning performance
    pass
```

### Test Case 5: Security Reporting
```python
def test_security_reporting():
    """Test security validation reporting"""
    # RED: Write failing test for reporting
    # GREEN: Implement security reporting
    # REFACTOR: Optimize report generation
    pass
```

## Success Metrics

- **Attack Detection**: 100% detection rate for common attack vectors
- **Performance**: Security validation completes in <2 seconds per file
- **False Positives**: <5% false positive rate for legitimate files
- **User Experience**: Clear security status indicators and detailed reports
- **Coverage**: All security components from SecurityConfig are demonstrated

## Dependencies

- Epic 1, Story 1: Environment Setup & Dependency Validation
- Epic 1, Story 2: Core Component Initialization
- SecurityConfig, PathSanitizer, FileValidator components
