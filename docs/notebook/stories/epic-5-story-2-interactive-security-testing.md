# Epic 5, Story 2: Interactive Security Testing

## Story Overview

**Epic**: Security & Validation Framework  
**Story ID**: 5.2  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 4 Story Points  

## User Story

**As a** security tester  
**I want** to test various security scenarios interactively  
**So that** I can validate the system's security posture  

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Predefined security test scenarios are available
- [ ] Custom security tests can be created and executed
- [ ] Security test results are visualized clearly
- [ ] Security risk assessment is performed automatically
- [ ] Security recommendations are provided

## TDD Requirements

- Write tests for security scenario execution before implementing testing framework
- Test risk assessment accuracy before creating assessment logic
- Verify recommendation quality before implementing recommendation engine

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Security scenarios cover all major threat vectors
- [ ] Test execution is reliable and repeatable
- [ ] Risk assessments are accurate and meaningful
- [ ] Recommendations help improve security posture
- [ ] All tests pass in RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Interactive widgets work smoothly
- [ ] Clear visual feedback provided to user
- [ ] Error handling for test failures implemented

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Interactive Testing Components
```python
# Security testing modules
from src.security.security import SecurityConfig, PathSanitizer, FileValidator
from src.utils.monitoring import SystemMonitor
from src.utils.performance import PerformanceMonitor

# Interactive widgets
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display, HTML, Markdown, clear_output
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```

### Security Test Scenarios
```python
def create_security_test_scenarios():
    """Create predefined security test scenarios"""
    scenarios = {
        'path_traversal': {
            'name': 'Path Traversal Attack',
            'description': 'Test path traversal vulnerability',
            'test_files': ['../../../etc/passwd', '..\\..\\windows\\system32']
        },
        'file_type_bypass': {
            'name': 'File Type Bypass',
            'description': 'Test file type validation bypass',
            'test_files': ['malicious.exe.txt', 'script.php.jpg']
        },
        'size_attack': {
            'name': 'Resource Exhaustion',
            'description': 'Test file size limit enforcement',
            'test_files': ['oversized_file.pdf']
        },
        'content_injection': {
            'name': 'Content Injection',
            'description': 'Test malicious content detection',
            'test_files': ['script_injection.html', 'sql_injection.txt']
        }
    }
    return scenarios

def execute_security_test(scenario_name, test_files):
    """Execute a security test scenario"""
    pass

def assess_security_risk(test_results):
    """Assess security risk based on test results"""
    pass

def generate_security_recommendations(risk_assessment):
    """Generate security improvement recommendations"""
    pass
```

### Interactive Widgets
```python
def create_scenario_selector():
    """Create widget for selecting security scenarios"""
    pass

def create_custom_test_builder():
    """Create widget for building custom security tests"""
    pass

def create_results_visualizer():
    """Create widget for visualizing test results"""
    pass

def create_risk_dashboard():
    """Create dashboard for risk assessment"""
    pass
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Scenario Execution
```python
def test_scenario_execution():
    """Test security scenario execution"""
    # RED: Write failing test for scenario execution
    # GREEN: Implement scenario execution
    # REFACTOR: Optimize execution performance
    pass
```

### Test Case 2: Risk Assessment
```python
def test_risk_assessment():
    """Test security risk assessment accuracy"""
    # RED: Write failing test for risk assessment
    # GREEN: Implement risk assessment logic
    # REFACTOR: Improve assessment accuracy
    pass
```

### Test Case 3: Custom Test Creation
```python
def test_custom_test_creation():
    """Test custom security test creation"""
    # RED: Write failing test for custom tests
    # GREEN: Implement custom test builder
    # REFACTOR: Optimize test creation workflow
    pass
```

### Test Case 4: Results Visualization
```python
def test_results_visualization():
    """Test security test results visualization"""
    # RED: Write failing test for visualization
    # GREEN: Implement results visualization
    # REFACTOR: Improve visualization clarity
    pass
```

### Test Case 5: Recommendation Engine
```python
def test_recommendation_engine():
    """Test security recommendation generation"""
    # RED: Write failing test for recommendations
    # GREEN: Implement recommendation engine
    # REFACTOR: Improve recommendation quality
    pass
```
