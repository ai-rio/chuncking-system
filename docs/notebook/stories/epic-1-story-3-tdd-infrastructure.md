# Epic 1, Story 3: TDD Test Infrastructure Setup

## Story Overview

**Epic**: Foundation Infrastructure & Environment Setup  
**Story ID**: 1.3  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 4 Story Points  

## User Story

**As a** developer following TDD principles  
**I want** a comprehensive test infrastructure within the notebook  
**So that** I can demonstrate the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for each feature  

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test execution framework is embedded in notebook cells
- [ ] RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle is clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Test results are visually displayed with status indicators
- [ ] Test coverage metrics are tracked and displayed
- [ ] Mock objects and fixtures are available for testing
- [ ] Test execution timing is measured and reported

## TDD Requirements

- Write failing tests for the test infrastructure itself (meta-TDD)
- Test the test execution framework before implementing it
- Verify test result visualization through automated tests

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All meta-tests pass in RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Test framework executes tests reliably
- [ ] Visual test results are clear and informative
- [ ] Test coverage tracking works correctly
- [ ] Mock framework is functional and documented

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Test Framework Components

    def __init__(self):
        self.tests = []
        self.results = []
        self.coverage_data = {}
    
    def add_test(self, test_func, description):
        """Add test to execution queue"""
        pass
    
    def run_tests(self, phase='RED'):
        """Execute tests and capture results"""
        pass
    
    def display_results(self):
        """Display test results with visual indicators"""
        pass
```

#### 2. TDD Cycle Tracker
```python
class TDDCycleTracker:
    """Track and visualize TDD cycle progression"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cycles = []
        self.current_phase = 'RED'
    
    def start_red_phase(self, feature_name):
        """Begin RED phase for feature"""
        pass
    
    def transition_to_green(self):
        """Move from RED to GREEN phase"""
        pass
    
    def transition_to_refactor(self):
        """Move from GREEN to REFACTOR phase"""
        pass
    
    def complete_cycle(self):
        """Complete current TDD cycle"""
        pass
    
    def visualize_progress(self):
        """Display TDD cycle progress"""
        pass
```

#### 3. Test Result Visualizer
```python
class TestResultVisualizer:
    """Create visual representations of test results"""
    
    def create_status_dashboard(self, results):
        """Create interactive test status dashboard"""
        pass
    
    def create_coverage_chart(self, coverage_data):
        """Create test coverage visualization"""
        pass
    
    def create_timing_chart(self, timing_data):
        """Create test execution timing chart"""
        pass
```

#### 4. Mock Framework Integration
```python
class NotebookMockFramework:
    """Simplified mock framework for notebook testing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.mocks = {}
    
    def create_mock(self, name, spec=None):
        """Create mock object"""
        pass
    
    def setup_fixtures(self):
        """Setup common test fixtures"""
        pass
    
    def cleanup_mocks(self):
        """Clean up mock objects"""
        pass
```

### Test Infrastructure Functions

```python
def setup_test_environment():
    """Initialize test environment for notebook"""
    pass

def run_red_phase_tests(feature_name, tests):

    pass

def run_green_phase_tests(feature_name, tests):
    """Execute GREEN phase tests (should pass)"""
    pass

def run_refactor_tests(feature_name, tests):
    """Execute REFACTOR phase tests (should still pass)"""
    pass

def display_tdd_summary():
    """Display comprehensive TDD cycle summary"""
    pass
