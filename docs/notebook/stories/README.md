## Development Guidelines

### TDD Implementation Standards

All stories must follow the **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** cycle:

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests that define the expected behavior
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

### Story Structure

Each story file contains:

- **Story Overview**: Epic, ID, priority, effort estimation
- **User Story**: As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable requirements
- **TDD Requirements**: Test-first development guidelines
- **Definition of Done**: Completion criteria
- **Technical Implementation Notes**: Detailed implementation guidance
- **Test Cases**: Specific test scenarios
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable success indicators
- **Dependencies**: Required prerequisites
- **Related Stories**: Connected development items

### Quality Gates
