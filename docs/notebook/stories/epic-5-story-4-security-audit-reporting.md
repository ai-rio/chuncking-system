# Epic 5, Story 4: Security Audit Reporting

## Story Overview

**Epic**: Security & Validation Framework  
**Story ID**: 5.4  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 3 Story Points  

## User Story

**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** comprehensive security audit reports  
**So that** I can demonstrate compliance with security requirements  

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security audit logs are comprehensive and detailed
- [ ] Audit reports can be generated in multiple formats

- [ ] Compliance status is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Audit trail integrity is maintained
- [ ] All tests pass in RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Reports generate without errors
- [ ] Multiple export formats supported
- [ ] Audit data is properly secured

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Security Audit Components
```python
# Security and audit modules
from src.security.security import SecurityConfig, PathSanitizer, FileValidator
from src.utils.monitoring import SystemMonitor, MetricsContainer
from src.utils.performance import PerformanceMonitor

# Reporting and data processing
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import json
import hashlib
import logging
from pathlib import Path
```

### Audit Logging Functions
```python
def setup_security_audit_logger():
    """Setup comprehensive security audit logging"""
    pass

def log_security_event(event_type, details, severity='INFO'):
    """Log security-relevant events with proper formatting"""
    pass

def log_file_validation(file_path, validation_result, security_checks):
    """Log file validation events"""
    pass

def log_sanitization_event(content_type, sanitization_result, performance_metrics):
    """Log content sanitization events"""
    pass

def log_security_test(test_name, test_result, risk_assessment):
    """Log security test execution and results"""
    pass
```

### Report Generation Functions
```python
def generate_security_summary_report(start_date, end_date):
    """Generate executive summary of security status"""
    pass

def generate_detailed_audit_report(audit_logs):
    """Generate detailed audit report with all events"""
    pass

def generate_compliance_report(compliance_framework='SOC2'):
    """Generate compliance-specific report"""
    pass

def generate_security_metrics_report(metrics_data):
    """Generate security metrics and trends report"""
    pass

def export_report(report_data, format='pdf', filename=None):
    """Export report in specified format (PDF, HTML, JSON, CSV)"""
    pass
```

### Audit Trail Security
```python
def calculate_audit_hash(audit_entry):
    """Calculate tamper-evident hash for audit entries"""
    pass

def verify_audit_integrity(audit_logs):
    """Verify audit trail integrity"""
    pass

def encrypt_sensitive_audit_data(audit_data):
    """Encrypt sensitive information in audit logs"""
    pass

def create_audit_chain(audit_entries):
    """Create blockchain-like audit chain for integrity"""
    pass
```

### Compliance Frameworks
```python
def get_compliance_requirements(framework):
    """Get compliance requirements for specific framework"""
    frameworks = {
        'SOC2': {
            'security_controls': ['access_control', 'encryption', 'monitoring'],
            'audit_requirements': ['continuous_monitoring', 'incident_logging'],
            'reporting_frequency': 'quarterly'
        },
        'ISO27001': {
            'security_controls': ['risk_assessment', 'security_policies', 'incident_management'],
            'audit_requirements': ['management_review', 'internal_audit'],
            'reporting_frequency': 'annual'
        },
        'GDPR': {
            'security_controls': ['data_protection', 'privacy_by_design', 'breach_notification'],
            'audit_requirements': ['data_processing_records', 'impact_assessments'],
            'reporting_frequency': 'as_needed'
        }
    }
    return frameworks.get(framework, {})
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Audit Log Completeness
```python
def test_audit_log_completeness():
    """Test that all security events are logged"""
    # RED: Write failing test for log completeness
    # GREEN: Implement comprehensive logging
    # REFACTOR: Optimize logging performance
    pass
```

### Test Case 2: Report Generation
```python
def test_report_generation():
    """Test security report generation"""
    # RED: Write failing test for report generation
    # GREEN: Implement report generation
    # REFACTOR: Improve report quality
    pass
```

### Test Case 3: Audit Trail Integrity
```python
def test_audit_trail_integrity():
    """Test audit trail tamper detection"""
    # RED: Write failing test for integrity verification
    # GREEN: Implement integrity checking
    # REFACTOR: Optimize integrity verification
    pass
```

### Test Case 4: Compliance Mapping
```python
