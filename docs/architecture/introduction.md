# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing **Chunking System** with **Docling multi-format document processing integration**. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing project architecture by defining how new components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## **Existing Project Analysis**

Based on my comprehensive analysis of your project structure and the existing `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`, I have identified the following about your existing system:

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose**: Production-ready enterprise-grade Markdown chunking system for RAG applications with comprehensive monitoring, security, and multi-LLM support
- **Current Tech Stack**: Python 3.11+ with LangChain 0.3.26+, Pydantic 2.11.7+, multi-LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Jina), comprehensive testing with pytest
- **Architecture Style**: Modular design with pluggable LLM provider factory pattern, layered architecture separating chunking logic, quality evaluation, and infrastructure concerns
- **Deployment Method**: Docker containerization with Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, health endpoints, and enterprise observability infrastructure

**Available Documentation:**
- Comprehensive technical specification and current system analysis in `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
- Detailed Docling integration planning in `docs/docling/` directory with technical specifications and agile project plans
- Complete PRD for brownfield enhancement in `docs/prd.md`
- Production-ready monitoring infrastructure with Grafana dashboards and Prometheus configurations

**Identified Constraints:**
- Must maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing Markdown processing workflows
- Performance impact must not exceed 20% for existing functionality
- Must preserve 95%+ test coverage requirement and comprehensive monitoring infrastructure
- Integration must follow established LLM provider factory pattern and existing architectural conventions
- Security framework must extend to new file formats while maintaining existing validation patterns
