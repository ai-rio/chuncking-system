# Security Integration

## **Existing Security Measures**

**Authentication**: Current system uses API key management for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Jina) through secure environment variable configuration with Pydantic SecretStr validation, following established credential handling patterns

**Authorization**: Existing role-based access through health endpoints and monitoring interfaces, current API access control patterns for provider switching and configuration management

**Data Protection**: Comprehensive input validation framework in src/utils/security.py with PathSanitizer for directory traversal prevention, FileValidator for content validation, existing checksum verification for file integrity

**Security Tools**: Current security validation includes file size limits, path sanitization, input validation utilities, automated vulnerability scanning in existing CI/CD pipeline with security-focused code review processes

## **Enhancement Security Requirements**

**New Security Measures**: 
- Extended file type validation for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, and image formats using python-magic for MIME type verification
- Docling API key management following existing SecretStr patterns with secure credential storage and rotation capabilities
- Enhanced file content scanning for multi-format documents with size limits, structure validation, and malicious content detection
- Vision processing security controls ensuring image content validation before Docling API submission

**Integration Points**: 
- Docling API communication security using existing HTTPS validation patterns and certificate verification
- Multi-format file upload security extending current file handling validation framework
- Enhanced monitoring and logging for security events related to new file types and processing methods
- Integration with existing security validation pipeline maintaining current threat detection capabilities

**Compliance Requirements**: 
- Maintain existing data protection standards for enhanced document types with appropriate PII detection and handling
- Extend current security audit logging to include multi-format processing events and Docling API interactions
- Preserve existing security posture while adding enhanced validation for complex document formats
- Compliance with current security policies for external API integration and data processing

## **Security Testing**

**Existing Security Tests**: Current security test suite validates file path sanitization, input validation effectiveness, API key management security, and existing provider authentication mechanisms

**New Security Test Requirements**: 
- Comprehensive multi-format file security testing including malicious document detection, oversized file handling, and malformed content validation
- Docling API security testing with credential validation, connection security verification, and error handling security assessment
- Enhanced file type validation testing ensuring python-magic integration prevents security bypass attempts
- Integration security testing validating secure data flow between existing components and new Docling processing

**Penetration Testing**: 
- Extended penetration testing scope to include multi-format document processing attack vectors
- Docling API integration security assessment with focus on credential handling and data transmission security
- File upload security testing for new supported formats with comprehensive malicious content scenarios
- Existing security testing framework extension to validate enhanced attack surface without compromising current security posture
