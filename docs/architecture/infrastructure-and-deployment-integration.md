# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## **Existing Infrastructure**

**Current Deployment**: Docker containerization with production-ready monitoring infrastructure including Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, comprehensive health endpoints, and enterprise observability stack  
**Infrastructure Tools**: Docker for containerization, Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for visualization, pytest for testing with 95% coverage requirements, existing CI/CD pipeline with quality gates  
**Environments**: Development, staging, production with environment-specific configuration management via Pydantic settings and environment variables

## **Enhancement Deployment Strategy**

**Deployment Approach**: Zero-downtime deployment leveraging existing Docker infrastructure with enhanced container including Docling dependencies. Maintain current deployment pipeline with additional Docling API key validation and multi-format file security checks integrated into existing CI/CD quality gates.

**Infrastructure Changes**: 
- Container image enhancement with Docling SDK and python-magic dependencies added to existing requirements
- Environment variable expansion for Docling configuration (DOCLING_API_KEY, DOCLING_BASE_URL) following current credential management patterns
- Enhanced health checks including Docling API connectivity verification integrated with existing health endpoint infrastructure
- Extended monitoring configuration with Docling-specific Prometheus metrics added to current observability stack

**Pipeline Integration**: 
- Existing pytest workflow extended with Docling integration tests maintaining 95% coverage requirement
- Current quality gates enhanced with multi-format security validation and Docling API connectivity checks
- Existing Docker build process updated to include new dependencies while preserving current image optimization
- Current deployment automation extended with Docling configuration validation following established patterns

## **Rollback Strategy**

**Rollback Method**: Feature flag-based rollback enabling selective disabling of Docling processing while maintaining existing Markdown functionality. Environment variable ENABLE_DOCLING_PROCESSING=false reverts to current behavior without code changes or redeployment.

**Risk Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms ensure system continues operating if Docling API unavailable
- Existing Markdown processing pathways remain completely unchanged providing guaranteed fallback capability
- Multi-format file validation prevents processing of potentially problematic documents
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting provide early warning of Docling integration issues

**Monitoring**: 
- Extended Prometheus metrics include Docling API response times, success rates, and error categorization
- Enhanced Grafana dashboards display multi-format processing statistics alongside existing system metrics
- Existing alerting rules supplemented with Docling-specific alerts for API failures and processing anomalies
- Current observability infrastructure maintains full visibility into system health during integration
