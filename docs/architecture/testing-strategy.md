# Testing Strategy

## **Integration with Existing Tests**

**Existing Test Framework**: pytest framework with comprehensive test suite organized in test_chunkers/, test_llm/, test_utils/ directories, maintaining 95% code coverage requirement with HTML coverage reporting and fail-under=80 enforcement

**Test Organization**: Current modular test structure mirrors source code organization with unit tests for individual components, integration tests for cross-component functionality, and end-to-end workflow validation matching existing patterns

**Coverage Requirements**: Maintain existing 95% coverage standard for all new Docling integration components, extend existing pytest-cov reporting to include multi-format processing validation, preserve current test execution and reporting workflows

## **TDD Implementation for New Components**

### **TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**

**Red Phase - Write Failing Tests First**:
- All new Docling integration components must begin with comprehensive failing test suites before any implementation code
- Test files created first: `test_docling_processor.py`, `test_docling_provider.py`, `test_enhanced_file_handler.py`
- Each test must define expected behavior, interfaces, and integration points based on architectural specifications
- Failing tests must validate all requirements from PRD and architecture document before implementation begins

**Green Phase - Minimal Implementation**:
- Write only enough implementation code to make tests pass, following existing code patterns
- Implement DoclingProcessor, DoclingProvider, and EnhancedFileHandler incrementally test by test
- Each implementation iteration must maintain integration with existing components without modification
- Code must follow existing patterns (BaseLLMProvider interface, current error handling, established configuration management)

**Refactor Phase - Code Quality Enhancement**:
- Refactor implementation code while keeping all tests green, maintaining existing code style standards
- Optimize integration with existing architecture patterns (factory registration, provider interfaces, monitoring integration)
- Ensure code follows existing Black/flake8/mypy standards and established documentation requirements
- Preserve backward compatibility and existing system performance characteristics

### **TDD Quality Gates**

**Code Review Validation**:
- All pull requests must demonstrate test-first development with test commits preceding implementation commits
- Code reviewers must verify TDD cycle compliance and validate test coverage before implementation review
- Review process must confirm tests adequately specify behavior before examining implementation quality
- Integration tests must validate existing system preservation alongside new functionality validation

**Commit History Verification**:
- Git commit history must show clear TDD progression with test commits followed by implementation commits
- Each feature branch must demonstrate Red-Green-Refactor cycle progression for all new components
- Commit messages must clearly indicate TDD phase (e.g., "RED: Add failing DoclingProcessor tests", "GREEN: Implement basic DoclingProcessor functionality")
- Test coverage reports must show incremental improvement aligned with implementation commits

**TDD Metrics Tracking**:
- Test-to-code ratio monitoring ensuring tests written before implementation code
- Cycle time measurement from failing test to green implementation to refactored solution
- Defect rate tracking comparing TDD-developed components with existing codebase quality metrics
- Test quality assessment measuring test effectiveness at catching regressions and integration issues

## **New Testing Requirements**

### **Unit Tests for New Components (TDD-Driven)**

**Framework**: pytest with existing test configuration and fixtures, maintaining current test discovery patterns and execution environment  
**TDD Approach**: 
- `test_chunkers/test_docling_processor.py` - Begin with failing tests for all DoclingProcessor methods before implementation
- `test_llm/test_docling_provider.py` - Start with failing BaseLLMProvider interface compliance tests
- `test_utils/test_enhanced_file_handler.py` - Create failing multi-format detection and routing tests first
**Coverage Target**: 95% minimum coverage achieved through TDD process, not retrofitted after implementation  
**Integration with Existing**: New TDD tests extend current test fixtures and utilities while validating existing component integration

### **Integration Tests (TDD-Enhanced)**

**TDD Integration Approach**: Write failing integration tests defining expected cross-component behavior before implementing component interactions

**Existing System Verification (Test-First)**:
- Create failing tests confirming existing Markdown processing must remain identical post-enhancement
- Write failing API contract tests validating no breaking changes to current interfaces before any code modification
- Implement failing performance benchmark tests ensuring existing processing characteristics preservation
- Develop failing quality evaluation tests confirming existing metrics calculations remain unchanged

**New Feature Testing (TDD Process)**:
- Begin with failing end-to-end multi-format processing tests defining expected workflow behavior
- Create failing Docling API integration tests with comprehensive mock scenarios before provider implementation
- Write failing enhanced quality evaluation tests specifying multi-format metrics behavior before evaluator enhancement
- Implement failing error handling tests defining graceful degradation requirements before exception handling code

### **Regression Testing (TDD-Informed)**

**TDD Regression Strategy**: Use TDD principles to create comprehensive regression test suite that defines preservation requirements before enhancement implementation

**Existing Feature Verification**: Create failing tests that specify exact existing behavior preservation requirements, ensuring tests fail if any current functionality changes during enhancement implementation

**Automated Regression Suite**: Develop failing regression tests defining complete existing workflow preservation before beginning any code modification, ensuring automated validation of current system integrity
