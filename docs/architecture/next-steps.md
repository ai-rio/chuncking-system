# Next Steps

## **Story Manager Handoff**

The Docling multi-format integration architecture is complete and ready for implementation. Based on comprehensive analysis of your existing production-ready chunking system, this enhancement will seamlessly integrate Docling's document processing capabilities while preserving all current functionality.

**Story Manager Implementation Prompt**:
```
Reference this architecture document (docs/architecture.md) and PRD (docs/prd.md) for Docling multi-format document processing integration. Key validated integration requirements:

- PROVEN PATTERN EXTENSION: Leverage existing LLM provider factory pattern by implementing DoclingProvider following BaseLLMProvider interface
- EXISTING SYSTEM PRESERVATION: All current Markdown processing, API interfaces, and monitoring infrastructure must remain identical
- TDD IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED: All new components must follow strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle with test-first development
- BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY CRITICAL: Zero breaking changes to existing functionality during phased implementation

Begin with Story 1.1 (DoclingProvider LLM Integration) as foundation component. Each story includes specific Integration Verification requirements to ensure existing system integrity throughout development.

Validated constraints from actual project analysis:
- 95% test coverage requirement maintained using TDD approach
- Performance impact within 20% tolerance for existing Markdown processing
- Enterprise monitoring and security framework integration mandatory
- Existing provider patterns (OpenAI, Anthropic, Jina) continue functioning unchanged
```

## **Developer Handoff**

Implementation teams can begin development using the comprehensive architectural blueprint and TDD requirements defined in this document.

**Developer Implementation Prompt**:
```
Begin Docling integration implementation following TDD principles and existing codebase patterns analyzed in docs/brownfield-architecture.md and defined in docs/architecture.md.

CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS based on validated project analysis:
- Follow existing code standards: Black formatting, flake8 compliance, mypy strict typing, 95% pytest coverage
- Implement DoclingProvider using established BaseLLMProvider interface pattern (src/llm/providers/base.py)
- Extend existing components following current patterns: FileHandler enhancement, quality evaluator extension
- Use existing infrastructure: Pydantic configuration, structured logging, Prometheus monitoring integration

TDD MANDATORY: Write failing tests first for all new components before implementation. Reference existing test patterns in test_chunkers/, test_llm/, test_utils/ directories.

INTEGRATION CHECKPOINTS: Each story includes Integration Verification requirements ensuring existing Markdown processing remains unchanged throughout implementation.

START WITH: Story 1.1 DoclingProvider foundation component following existing provider registration and factory patterns.
