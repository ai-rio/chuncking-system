## Executive Brief

**Mission**: Identify and validate the optimal vertical niche market for our enterprise AI solution (PocketFlow + NextJS-FastAPI + Milvus + Enhanced Chunking System) using Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) principles to achieve customer delight from day one in the Brazilian market.

**Objective**: Move beyond MVP thinking to discover a vertical market in Brazil where our unified AI solution doesn't just "work" but makes customers exclaim "Isso é brilhante!" (This is brilliant!) and creates lasting competitive advantage in the Latin American market.

**Brazilian Market Context**: Brazil represents the largest economy in Latin America with unique regulatory requirements (LGPD), Portuguese language processing needs, and specific business cultural considerations that create both opportunities and challenges for AI solutions.
